 * by multiple facets of the contract without memory slot collisions.
 *
 * AppStorage is used to declare shared variables across the modular architecture of the contract,
 * facilitating state management, access control, configuration, and other cross-facet functionalities.
 *
 * This library is essential for maintaining consistency and efficiency in Diamond contracts.
